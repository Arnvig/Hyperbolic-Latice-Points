# Hyperbolic-Latice-Points
Code to Master Thisis about Hyperbolic Lattice Counting problem and the equidistribution of those

There are are 3 files:
CountSLPointsByHarddics.jl
This code is used to count hyperbolic lattice points and hyperbolic lattice "primes"

SL2z-Plots.jl
This is used to visuel SL Points.

All_Code.jl
Almost all code, and random code sipets.
There are some unused function, like foldpostivecoprime, that can be used to very fast maps a function unto postiveprimes and can be used to fast count lattice points and more.
